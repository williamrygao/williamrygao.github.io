# A complete guide to insufficiency

<p class="date">APRIL 2025</p>

Two men standing. At the 125th Biennial Tainted and Shrewd Crusade Against Ã‰lan Vital. Bahen Centre for Information Technology, room 6202. 21st-century naumachia. The finalists' task is scrawled across the chalkboard always lightly veiled in dust, in stition more super than Man Proposes, God Disposes, the stone is rolled away, the slate is wiped clean, the commandment reads COLOURLESS GREEN IDEAS SLEEP FURIOUSLY, THUS WILL YOU PREPARE A KETTLE OF TEA. The physicist overfulls a kettle, flips it alive, bolts off in search of lost tea. The mathematician Vicario unhurriedly strolls away and returns with a righthandful of leaves, bringing water to a boil as Valerio clambers back. Stalemate. Umpire declares rematch on the twenty-third hour. Come the smiling morn, Vicario and Valerio no fresher than the day before, the same commandment unveiled. Valerio rapidly switches on yesterday's kettle and proudly waits for the tea to reheat. Vicario pours out yesterday's tea, and proudly exclaims: "by reducing to the previous problem, we are done." Ovation related or unrelated resounds from down the hall.

There are two obvious interpretations of this parable. First, the mathematician is delusional. The mathematician has so lost their minds in transfinite inductions and reductio ad absurdums that they cannot solve the simplest of real-world problems. Second, the mathematician will always outclass the physicist. It would be an insult to the haughty mathematician's intellect to make any reasonable attempt at any real-world problem.
