# Making math more accessible
<p class="font3 right">28 JULY 2025</p>

I've been trying to refine my goals regarding math, so that I can (a) orient my work to directly address them, instead of a target as lofty as "making math more accessible", and (b) recognize when I've realized them, so that I might divert my attention to other pressing problems. I've honed in on at least two relatively broad goals:
1. Accelerating the acquisition of participatory knowledge of mathematics.
2. Facilitating useful applications of concepts in abstract mathematics.

My inspiration for the first goal was the observation that almost nobody would benefit from knowing what a category is (propositional), or knowing how to prove Yoneda's lemma (procedural), or knowing to view a group as a category with a single object (perspectival), but almost everybody would benefit from the pattern-recognition, chunking skills, and other forms of participatory knowledge that one develops by learning category theory. Although participatory knowledge may be the most universally important, it is currently the most difficult to initially develop. Vaguely construed, math is about ideas; I would like it to be possible to communicate these ideas without the drudgery of sesquipedalian definitions and acrobatic proofs (I like these, but most people do not and should not). In this case, the initial learning curve for participatory knowledge would steepen and advanced ideas could conceivably be introduced to anyone sufficiently determined to learn.

I'm tempted to throw in perspectival knowledge as well, but I think this is more specifically useful to the natural sciences and largely coincides with the second goal.

Speaking of, the natural sciences are missing out on a good part of 80 years of mathematical progress. As far as I'm aware, the most recent truly helpful application of math in the natural sciences was Gröbner bases for computational chemistry. Gröbner bases are 60 years old. I would even claim applied math, AI, and computer science are at least 30 years behind. The 2018 dimension reduction algorithm UMAP would not exist today without category theory (80 years old) and Riemannian manifolds (more than 100 years old). Don't even ask the age of the math underlying neural networks, which constitute 99% of what people call AI. Some recent work in formal languages uses techniques from homotopy type theory which I'd consider around 20-30 years old, but it's yet to yield useful applications, although it has tremendous potential. And anecdotally, my research in quantum groups leads me to believe they are more likely to be applied to AI models than quantum mechanics.

This is mostly the fault of mathematics. If you ask a mathematician for an application of their work, the answer will be one of the following:
* a corollary in another, usually less advanced, part of mathematics.
* a trivial identification of the concept in an applied setting, but the identification is completely useless in that it has yet to generate any novel insight.

I know I'm guilty of such responses as well. Abstract math is horribly inaccessible to anyone who lacks years of mathematical training, which is a relatively large problem for science trying to select the most appropriate mathematical tools for its ideas. There are so many ways to address this issue, but some of the most appealing to me are:
* formulating more self-contained descriptions of mathematical concepts.
* increasing the mathematical literacy of future generations.
* generating (likely financial) incentives for mathematicians to discuss with natural scientists, and for scientists to learn and incorporate mathematical ideas in their work.
