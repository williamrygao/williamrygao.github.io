# Pathological ramificursions in sentiment and brutality
<p class="date">March 2025</p>

Each year, the *Annals of Mathematics* withstands as many submissions as there are unemployed Ivy League PhD graduates. Among the goofs and gaffes and guts and guiles of these indelible souls a stoic sitzfleisch rests certain as the tickening of the atomic tock. Its progenitor kindergarten lletraferit Mister Gao — cero preprints or publications. Its title *Pathological ramificursions in sentiment and brutality.* Its contents nil — but an abstract which deflects more than it reveals. History prescribes for such instances of blasphemy to be met with public execution and / or castration. But the editorial board has with pity or anticipation tolerated his yearly submission, which is included below without his solicitation.

<p class="narrow">
    What bee comes of desire when we see face to face. The sickness hoopoe presaged aflight the gorges of belief and unbelief, and ascended onto, incinerating the scars of stillness. Sweet drone of deceit electric, butchery tastes Glagolitic, love and transcendence wordless recognitions unearthing the carcass of a battlefield of ideals. When the lillywhite ocean is but a catacomb, lived through, charted deep and wide, all it once could bear fruit and monstrosity stalked and slain, letterwounded; amor fati. Not a wound, these selfish genes could not quell such a tremoling hand. Yet the hand speaks conviction. I found my self in these letters like I found your eye balls among nine hundred. How Lord of Any Place, could you condemn me with a choice. My hammering heart for a sturdy spine. A dynamic program, time-space bargain. A dynamical system, any way the wind blows. And fifty letters more till flies I draw, till dots do us part. A Killing form, nondegenerate if and only if semisimple. A Killing joke, with every heedless day the humour wears thinner, reality raps realer. Till then mirrors can only scrape at the walls; vile travesty will not seize me; my reflections unveil themselves. What being belies this seeming, is this history. Nebules of blood, nebular guilt, and nebulous desire. The numbers 1, 2, 4, and 8; who is the invariant one, trotting parallel spheres, not a shadow to chase. All I raise is to see your image imbedded in the angelic orders.

The *Annals* returns forevermore the same comment, presumably automated by now:

    How did'ya happen to find me, sir? Thought my bones too brittle to bend, thought my footing too frit to falter. Have you gripp'd his red right hand; Have you volunteered, to God, your own, my surrogate?
