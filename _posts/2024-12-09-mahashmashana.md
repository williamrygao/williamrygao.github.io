# Knowing I didn't go nearly far enough.
<p class="font3 right">12 DECEMBER 2024</p>

The best part about Father John Misty releasing what may be the greatest
album he'll ever make just in time for my finals is having an aqueduct for all the
excellent ideas that occur to me during my pre-exam delirium. Because music is
more poignant when it's anchored to salient experiences, and music criticism is
more compelling when it's drowned in the critic's weltanschauung.

The smooth watch reset. The oar plunged into streams of tendency. The great
annihilator devours what little light remains and is reformed, hunger renewed.
Stories so familiar, now impossible to ignore in the gentle tepid stream's rupturing.

The gulfstream's convulsing perpetuates. I commit to a schema of restricted 
comprehension. A courseload that will surely be my ruin. A project that I am vastly
underqualified to undertake (viz. the words you're reading). As if by divine
intervention, I emerge unscathed. Mostly. Could it be marvelous capitalism bestowing
a bounty to all those who toil like Trojans? In Maya's grip sheds illusion, by
which every man thirsts to be unique. And under the veil tone-deafly cries:

*A modern Sisyphean ritual: 'Working on hard problems.'*

Those who knew my prepubescent years may find it suprising that I say this 
(although a little sardonically). After all, solving hard technical problems was 
essentially the modus operandi of my youth, and what initially thrusted me mathward.
The siren song may have been validation, or the heel of social circles, the North
American education system, career advising centres, and job descriptions. But I
am not Sisyphus, and so I must sail with the slightest of deliberation. Whither, you
might ask? An obvious course, to reject this landfall entirely. To pray that
general problem solving computers will come soon enough that we won't need
ourselves, that we could live the rest of our lives unmanned. Horrifying.
Another, to bow my head and weather my Sisyphean fate. To sail forbidden enough seas
and land on barbarous enough coasts, out of not
perdurance, but madness. To turn my mind into a machine. Also horrifying.
When choosing between Scylla and Charybdis, we are taught to choose the passage
in between. All it demands is a drop of courage and a swell of energy.
I don't have much difficulty forging the courage to clean the Augean stables.
And no matter how infrequently inspiration might strike, we'd all be dead if there was 
none at all.

If I'm being optimistic, we're not all dead. And we're wholly responsible
for choosing where to dedicate the little energy we have left. So I'm breaking the
cycle. I don't think that entails abandoning math entirely, but I am abandoning a lot 
of what originally convinced me to do math (stupidity). I've worried far less about 
memorizing every theorem and definition, or solving every exercise in the book, and
more about the intuition that makes mathematics so beautiful. Substituting
perfectionism with (post-post-)postmodern maximalism. Balancing every fallen star with a 
Gelson's. Dual scales ethereal and corporeal. In the celestial plane, lightyears above
the heads of you and I, their metaphysical frolic smiles upon us, and we carry ourselves
to its rhythm. It's a mysticism we all believe in, yet we cannot know why. And we cannot
interrupt it — our incompetence in this right is the root of all our misery. Its scale
and irreconcilable absurdity inflicts in us an unshakeable urge to play the Godhead, to
upscale our conquest of all the sea. Our trembling dance yields glints of love and truth,
but it is all lost faster than it is found. Mahāśmaśāna (महामशान) — great cremation ground,
all things put going thither — the only eternal story: Gilgamesh, Bible, Qu'ran.

That's as good as I can do for the first track, which sets the stage for the rest of
the album. I really should study for CSC265 now, so I'll just leave my favourite
lyrics from each remaining song:
<p class="center"><i>&ldquo;The aggrieved becomes aggressor and we do it all again.&rdquo;</i> — She Cleans Up</p>

<p class="center"><i>&ldquo;I'd forfeit my existence
if someone let me just play with them.&rdquo;</i> — Josh Tillman and the Accidental Dose</p>

<p class="center"><i>&ldquo;Oh, magic child, this dream we're born inside feels awful real sometimes, but it's all in your mind.&rdquo;</i> — Mental Health</p>

<p class="center"><i>&ldquo;The optimist swears hope dies last, and shoots the lamplight clean from the brakeman's hand.&rdquo;</i> — Screamland</p>

<p class="center"><i>&ldquo;In my memory is a show I call the past: I watch and decide just what I would do next.&rdquo;</i> — Being You</p>

<p class="center"><i>&ldquo;I followed my dreams and my dreams said to crawl.&rdquo;</i> — I Guess Time Just Makes Fools of Us All</p>

<p class="center"><i>&ldquo;What do you tell the madman who wants to see you dead, when against your will comes wisdom and 40 more years left ahead?&rdquo;</i> — Summer's Gone</p>

So I'm learning to love the war, to not become too consumed with the present
and its horrors, to take a chance on eternity. I often fear we're biologically
wired to disregard anything other than the present moment. But isn't living all
about miraculously adjusting our default settings? The exact orientation that sustains the 
repulsive belief that my personal reality is the realer than any other (cf. I'm Writing a 
Novel)? Could belief in the future, as trivial as it sounds, be the key to conjuring beauty 
in a void?
