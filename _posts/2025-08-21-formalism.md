# Formalism is a Brahmanism
<p class="font3 right">21 AUGUST 2025</p>

A brief apocryphon according to mathematician and philosopher Gian-Carlo Rota in *Discrete Thoughts* attests that Frank Ramsey[^1] asked Ludwig Wittgenstein[^2]:

> Suppose a contradiction were to be found in the axioms of set theory. (*Pointing to a bridge*) Do you seriously believe that that bridge would fall down?

The more I learn about the history of mathematics, the more puzzled I become about mathematical foundations. As of writing this, sets are the building blocks of mathematics. But Alexander Grothendieck[^3] famously wanted to reformulate mathematics in the language of category theory, viewing set-theoretic formalism as anachronistic.

It's unfortunate his vision was largely resisted by his coequals in the ever-influential Bourbaki[^4] collective, because he is correct in ways more than one. Fields of mathematics such as algebraic geometry already seem to consider the concept of a category to be nearer to the truth than the concept of a set. Although evidence is severely limited, homotopy type theory seems to provide a more intelligible map for those territories which have proven to be difficult to formalize via set theory, with language acting as the poster child. Philosophically, many consider category theory's emphasis on morphisms or maps between objects to be a more natural (human) perspective than set theory's emphasis on the objects themselves. For the computer scientists in need of an analogy, category theory bears the spirit of functional programming, while set theory bears the spirit of object-oriented programming. I'll let you decide which one you'd rather lay your bridges on.

On the other hand, some reasons for Bourbaki and nearly every other authority on mathematics are quite clear. There exist political reasons; ultimately, Bourbaki's goal was to unify modern mathematical tradition. There also exist pedagogical reasons; this could be my status quo bias but I feel like it would be difficult to blackbox category-theoretic foundations in the way undergraduate education blackboxes set theory. But knowing Bourbaki's math-first modus operandi, I would find it hard to believe that they would willingly implement an anachronism for purely political and/or pedagogical reasons, without mathematical justification. As far as I can tell, their explanations of their choice of mathematical foundations are even more arcane than their usual writing, so here's mine.

Fundamentally, mathematics grew out of a desire to understand. It doesn't seem to matter so much what it is we understand; mathematical gold is struck by standing under under-standing itself. But at the risk of running a pyramid scheme, we do not solve problems for the sake of solving problems. We solve problems so that their solutions may generate ideas. Mathematical gold is not truth, but insight. Truth (according to some formalism) is one way to verify the consistency of these ideas. But truth does not suffice to ensure the insight of these ideas. Elegance, scale, beauty, and novelty are just as important as truth when appraising mathematical gold.

Venturing deeper into the Freudian, it makes sense that set theoretic formalism comes almost entirely from the West, despite the great mathematical dynasties across the Orient. The desire to minimize original assumptions, to have all knowledge and beauty emanate from a single source, is starkly Abrahamic to me. One God, one source, one axiom[^5]. The Western mind is steeped in Judeo-Christian ideals, and these ideals of elegance, scale, beauty, and novelty have precisely defined the course of the mathematical gold rush according to the desire that our mathematical foundations should quench our thrist for singularity. With a view towards oneness, set theory distinguishes itself with a landslide as the simplest and most centralized, hence the most natural candidate.

This conspiracy theory leaves a lot to ponder. If the primary driver of mathematical progress was a culture rooted in Hindu ideals, maybe we'd be working in the language of category theory today. At least, it might strike me as a natural progression from polytheistic thought, being less centralized and more eclectic than set theory. Or what is more likely, no object resembling a category or set would have been formulated at all.

[^1]: of Ramsey theory fame.
[^2]: Wittgenstein is known for many great ideas, but you may be familiar with his *Sprachspiel*, or language-game. He explains that the rules of a language resemble those of a game. But what is a game?
[^3]: Grothendieck is among the greatest mathematicians of all time, do not let anyone tell you otherwise.
[^4]: Other well-known members have included: André Weil who is distinct from Hermann Weyl but proposed the famous now-resolved Weil conjectures; Claude Chevalley of the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition; Henri Cartan son of the more famous Élie Cartan; Szolem Mandelbrojt uncle of the more famous Benoit Mandelbrot; Jean-Pierre Serre arguably the best mathematical writer ever; Serge Lang arguably the second best mathematical writer ever.
[^5]: Well, ZFC consists of nine axioms but remarkable work has been done to cut our assumptions down to these nine, and remarkable work continues to be done in the hope of further cutting down.
