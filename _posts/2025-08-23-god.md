*How to stage a crisis of faith, for people who are exactly like me.*

![Man Proposes, God Disposes](/assets/images/man-proposes-god-disposes.jpg)
*Man Proposes, God Disposes* by Sir Edwin Landseer, 1864. Oil on canvas.

> "Today is the twelfth day of the first month of the year two thousand twenty-five. And if you can believe it, I'm staging a crisis of faith."

It's now August, and I've brought my crisis of faith to a conclusion. In fairness, the real crisis of faith — where all information is equally true and all outcomes are equally probable — began some time in March. So what was I doing between January and March? That time was certainly not wasted, but it was spent sorting out ideas that seem unmistakably true to most long-time believers, unmistakably false to most skeptics, and seemingly due to personal differences, negligible to most newly-converted believers. I found myself in a pitch dark room fumbling around for a hypothetical light switch.

Churches and religious organizations make an appreciable effort to create grayspaces[^1]. But the fact that they are organized by churches and religious organizations is a considerable flaw for those who find themselves in a pitch dark room fumbling around for a hypothetical light switch. This is almost tautological, because who else but believers would want to convert nonbelievers to their respective beliefs? But I think the nature of religious faith makes it difficult for religious believers to distinguish the dilemma

> How can I accept long-rejected true belief X?

from the very distinct dilemma

> How do I know if long-rejected belief X is true?

Mathematically speaking, the latter is more difficult to resolve. If X is (provably) true, a sufficiently brilliant somebody will one day devise a proof. To decide if X is true, many brilliant somebodies will labour for a proof that may not even exist, all while combing through a vast arsenal of potential counterexamples. If either heuristic fails, they still haven't proven that X is false (resp. true), they've only proven that their inability to show X is true (resp. false). The first class consists of conjectures, the second class consists of every question one can possibly ask. Clearly the first is much more restricted and more well-defined.

Yet numerous continue to conflate the two, and it doesn't help that theological beliefs can be some of the most ill-defined and unexplainable beliefs a person can hold, relative to their strength and certainty. Religious grayspaces are generally good at equipping people with the resources they need to approach the first dilemma. They're probably not what you're looking for when attacking the second. I'd recommend taking these initiatives in small doses, but if you're exactly like me, most of it will be impossible to swallow at first.

So where should one look when trying to decide whether a religion is true? Does everyone simply have to fumble around for a hypothetical light switch in a pitch dark room? Probably. There exists no user manual to instruct you on the existence and / or location of a hypothetical light switch, and even if there did, you wouldn't be able to read it until you've found the light switch on your own, because the room is too dark! As a result, everyone who finds it does so following a unique path, and everyone who concedes does so following a unique path. The best advice I can provide is thus extremely specific. I've compiled a detailed record of my path towards deciding that light switch exists and eventually finding it. If you're exactly like me, I hope this can act as a very dim candle that illuminates a five-centimetre radius. Be warned though, the candle will most likely gutter out just before you reach the light switch (if you decide it exists).

## On rationality; or, why floating beliefs might not be evil
One reason why religious beliefs are so ineffable is that they are, barring a most momentous revolution in the way we interact with reality, neither provable nor disprovable. In other words, they don't constraint experience. And they aren't particularly willing to be discarded, should evidence of implausibility arise. Instead, believers are repeatedly instructed to 'have faith'. As far as I can tell, few religions constitutionally condemn doubt, but an unfortunate number of religious institutions do. The effacing of doubt, one of the human mind's rare assets, and the ensuing [invisible dragon fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CqyJzDZWvGhhFJ7dY/belief-in-belief) are quite uncomfortable to the critical mind. My education has taught me that such beliefs (henceforth to be referred to as 'floating beliefs') are useless.

It's a patently rationalist mindset. Beliefs serve the unique purpose of anticipating future experience, ergo any belief that does not pay rent in predictive power deserves to be evicted. There's [a](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XrzQW69HpidzvBxGr/affective-death-spirals) [panoply](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fAuWLS7RKWD2npBFR/religion-s-claim-to-be-non-disprovable) [of](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PMr6f7ZocEWFtCYXj/is-humanism-a-religion-substitute) [posts](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A/making-beliefs-pay-rent-in-anticipated-experiences) on LessWrong expounding on this perspective. Thus I am willing to admit that rationality, narrowly construed[^2], is incompatible with religion.

But what reason does rationality have? How can we be sure that the scientific method / Bayesian inference / induction will continue to work reliably? Do we just need to 'have faith'? Eliezer Yudkowsky [says yes](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zmSuDDFE4dicqd4Hg/you-only-need-faith-in-two-things):

> You only need faith in two things: That "induction works" has a non-super-exponentially-tiny prior probability, and that some single large ordinal is well-ordered. Anything else worth believing in is a deductive consequence of one or both.

I'm not here to doubt Eliezer's "two things"; I do believe in the scientific method as one of humanity's sharpest tools, and I do believe that behaving rationally is almost always optimal. I'm here to doubt the uniqueness claim: that these are the *only* two things I need faith in, that *anything else* worth believing in follows.

Ultimately, I think it reduces to some fundamental differences regarding how we interpret value in science. In my opinion, the purpose of a scientific theory is not to predict, but to understand. Predictive power can measure the accuracy of our understanding, but undestanding must also meet some standard of elegance, scale, and beauty. Jakob Schwichtenberg [illustrates](https://substack.com/@jakobschwichtenberg/p-156527602) a similar argument more convincingly than I can, but I think this model is more faithful to the history and current state of science than the Yudkowskian alternative.

If you're exactly like me, this should already convince you that floating beliefs might not be evil. Even more scathingly, Eliezer assumes that we should minimize our assumptions whenever possible. (At least I don't see how this might follow from the first two claims, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong on this). I will admit this assumption is still weaker than "Christ died for your sins", but it's likely closer than we think. This assumption-cutting desire shared by mathematicians and rationalists alike is somehow an incarnation of Occam's razor, and I recently published [a conspiracy theory](/formalism) that it has origins in Abrahamic thought, rather than Aristotle. And if you're exactly like me, you're probably unwilling to gamble on Occam's razor with your life, not to mention eternity. Even mathematicians have steered away from Occam's razor (although not without controversy). The axiom of choice is now widely accepted by the mathematical community despite being famously unintuitive and almost certainly an overestimation of humanity's capabilities, for the sake of mere mathematical convenience[^3].

So what's one more axiom if it could improve our ability to act as rational agents? After all, hasn't the objective always been [applied](https://www.rationality.org/) [rationality](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/)? What's one more ounce of faith if it makes the difference between a sky full of stars and a handful of dust?

## On salvation; or, why dualist eternalism isn't obviously wrong
Of course, we must not equivocate belief and [belief in belief](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/belief-in-belief). Belief in belief is just shy of the most fatal epistemic error one can commit; we cognitive agents must strive to possess a naive view of truth. When you place math at the center of your life, this naive view of truth lodges itself in the esophagus, next to the heart. Regrettably, mathematics and this naive view of truth has very little to do with the structure of reality. You'll spit it out the moment you flash a smile at a stranger on the street, or as soon as you pour your blood onto the pavement.

Until around 2023, I categorically rejected dualist eternalism[^4] because I saw it as a most blatant example of belief in belief. I assumed saviour narratives were all lies told to give people a reason when they saw none. I never asked for a saviour, and I thought it selfish to believe I would be granted one. Eventually, I was fortunate enough to meet people who believed not in belief, but in truth. And I was pleasantly surprised to learn that their truth involved religion in such a visceral way, impacting their lives in ways I could not fathom. Only then did I begin to understand David Foster Wallace's [This is Water](https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/):

> Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship–be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles–is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive.

I recognized this as the strongest and most universal argument in favour of religion anyone would ever conceive. During my more recent reading, I traced the argument back to Simone Weil, then to Søren Kierkegaard, even to Augustine of Hippo, and all the way to Jesus Christ. At each step, it gained one level of abstraction and lost one degree of specificity.

However, I now know I hadn't really *recognized* the argument. I stated that I intend to fill in the specifics where they had been missing for me, so here's my refinement of the argument, one level more concrete and one degree more specific than Wallace. Dualism is inescapable. Whether it's eternalist or nihilist or something in between, something separate from you will always rule you. One could repeat to themself *cogito, ergo sum* until they decompose, but it will never amount to more than belief in belief.

I am decidedly not a nihilist. Having lived the reality of this something in between for my entire life, I'm quite convinced it must be a discrete combination of the two poles rather than a homogeneous mixture, as one might hope. If you're exactly like me and want no part in nihilism, this incongruence is a little bit crippling. Naturally, I long suspected that I was unknowingly clinging to a saviour narrative. I pondered this for a few years, and would have had much less difficulty accepting it if it weren't for my prolonged incompetence at identifying one. I unearthed subtle hints in the lives of those around me. I witnessed sufficiently many saviour roles being projected onto other human beings to prevent myself from making the same mistake. But Bayesian inference, artistic perfection, transhumanism, the longevity escape velocity, AGI; all of these appealed to me at one point or another.

It makes awful sense to me now. Mathematics is erudite, aesthetically divine, seemingly impossible to doubt. The obvious problem with math being one's saviour is that it has absolutely nothing to do with reality. Specially given my preference for the abstract nonsense mathematics over the worldly and statistical, it's a miracle that I learned to live in the way I did while worshipping something so unreal.

So even if I didn't ask for a saviour, I inevitably clung onto one. I know now that a saviour narrative is bad if and only if it is a lie. Is religion a lie?

* I want a more compelling treatment of the in between of eternalism and nihilism, because that's where I was before. What caused the shift?

## On truth; or, why Christianity?
Perhaps one day we might travel back in time and witness the inception of each religion that has ever existed in order to directly evaluate their integrity, but for now, we can be comfortable accepting certain things on faith.

The great news is that faith is a choice. Anyone is free to decide for themselves which religions are true and which are not. Only a small fraction of what I've written thus far is specific to Christian faith, and if the reader would like to apply these words to a different faith, I wish them equally well. Yet the crisis of faith I've undergone has convinced me more of the Christian faith than any other, and this merits an explanation as much as all that precedes. An embarassing majority of these ideas are borrowed from [René Girard](https://iep.utm.edu/girard/).

Nietzsche criticized Christianity's 'slave morality'. In the New Testament, Jesus promotes humility, submission, mercy; these virtues were once considered weaknesses. Nietzsche thus considers the Passion of Christ to be a corruption of human power and strength.

Girard applauds Nietzsche, not for his eventual interpretation, but for his rare recognition that Christianity is singular in its solidarity with the weak, the poor, the victims of violence. Girard's interpretation is opposite: the crucifixion of Christ is the primeval violent act, a reversal of the violent foundations of human culture that would be impossible if not by divine intervention. The New Testament is a recognition of Jesus as Christ, the faultless scapegoat. His identification with God is not a burdensome detail, but an integral component to God's ultimate sacrifice.

This sacrifice is dual to the Bible's account of dualist eternalism. It subverts the mimetic cycle of violence that turns beneath civilization while making known the presence of an infinite grace as an alternative, redeeming both victims and perpetrators, because truthfully we all belong to both. Among all accounts of eternalism I am aware of, the Christian story is the unique account that is sufficiently extreme to justify its claim to eternity and sufficiently complete to justify the perceived scarcity of divine intervention in our world today. In uncountably many ways, the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ is infinitely more than we humans could ever deserve.

* I want a more compelling argument for why Christianity fulfills the eternalist story so completely. Uniqueness among religions is probably clear, but how does any religion even convince that God exists?

[^1]: Synonyms include onramp or airlock.
[^2]: I use the term 'rationality' in a much more restricted sense than you probably have in mind. I'm mostly referring to the modern rationality movement as pioneered by Eliezer Yudkowsky, documented by [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) and beyond. I think this is the closest rationality has come to an enactable belief system, and it has deeply influenced the way I form beliefs.
