# A complete guide to insufficiency

<p class="font3 right">24 MAY 2025</p>

My 12- and 13-year-old cousins are diehard football / soccer fans, and every so often I discern some wisdom from their echoes of the sport's fervour, politics, and artifice. And yesterday, I heard one of the coldest quotes from Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes:

<p class="narrow">
    “The manager and physio say that I need to relax and rest, but I say no. When I die, I will have a lot of time to lay down and rest.”
</p>

Fernandes' quote is strangely reminiscent of [Julia Wise's (or Julia's wise) words on the decision of parenthood](http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/cheerfully.html) (“My happiness is not the point”). Julia contends that there exist sacrifices we simply should not make, for making them would compromise our first fundamental strength as a~~n altruist~~ human being: to walk cheerfully. Julia largely omits (or is sharp enough to be immune to) the frequent dolour in recognizing when this is the case, or when one's emotions are simply insufficiently aligned.

For most of my life, I've done a sloppy job at identifying the conditions which nurture my first fundamental strength. However, I've done a more-than-decent job at embodying, embedding, enacting, and extending the second fundamental strength, which I'll define as the allocation of resources: time, energy, money, attention, ad infinitum. There is a canonical necessity in the first fundamental strength to the second, arising as urgency, intrinsic motivation, willingness to give back, frictionlessness, ad infinitum. Thus using the second as an objective function became a sensible heuristic for optimizing the first.

While I don't feel as inclined as Julia to become a parent, I might expect to become similarly embittered if I were demanded to give up all mathematics. I'm in the process of exploring less math-intensive career options, and these prospects make me feel vaguely dismayed, though bearably so. However, if a career were to swallow enough of my time and/or freedom that I could not do math at all, I would not be astonished to watch it formally compromise my first fundamental strength.

In this case, the second fundamental strength heuristic delineates a clear inferential pathway. I have more consistently rationed my depleting economy, conjured raison d'être, cheerfully returned favours, and shower-pondered on the subject of math than any other. I can even retrace certain remote causes for this, from the wonderful math education I was fortunate to receive and the vast network of magicians I met via math.

I've implemented this line of thinking when reasoning about other commitments and ambitions, including:
* majoring in math,
* **attending grad school,**
* taking a course,
* writing,
* reading,
* *finding a career trailhead,*
* **responding to a job offer,**
* exercising,
* attending an event,
* **friendships and dating.**

My anticipation of grad school has oscillated faithfully with Foucault's pendulum, but (I think) it has finally stabilized after passing the prospect through this lens. At times I regarded those five years with the lilywhite gaze that is reserved for the most idyllic years of one's life, at others I was convinced it would be an elaborate waste of time. On one side it's the surest way to advance a career in mathematics, on another side it's largely postponing what I want to do most with my career. While five years is unlikely to be a career-defining span of time, there exist paths (i.e. quant) along which the impact I could make (i.e. donating even 10% of my salary) in such a short interval is exceedingly nonnegligible.

The difficulty was that a vast majority of the career paths I was considering required a PhD. As one might guess, this didn't work particularly well as motivation. Furthermore, grad school is a financial gamble, a probable mental strain, and applying involves some high-friction processes such as writing the GRE. In reaction, I spent more time carving out desirable career paths that would not depend on me attending grad school. In the process of, I recognized that my second fundamental strength for math-related activities worked best in those months during which I was not constantly thinking about grad school and not utterly convinced I should attend. Maybe counterintuitively, I studied more effectively, attended more seminars and took better notes at those seminars, produced higher output in my teaching and grading, and spent even more idle time running proofs from one ear to the other. In essence, my caring for math seems predominantly disjoint from my attendance of grad school, so I'm inclined to proclaim that waiving grad school is a sacrifice I can cheerfully make. Even if I still plan to apply, through this understanding I've become less consumed by the looming threat of grad school applications and more cheerful with respect to my own mathematical life.

Deciding what will allow us to walk cheerfully is rarely so bifurcate as the previous examples. Faced with uncountably many options, it's possible we will only realize, years later, that our choice gradually drained us of our saltiness. While I have yet to fossilize my career path (I've yet to collect enough data to run my second fundamental form heuristic), I faced a microcosmic plight when selecting from various roles available to me for this summer; unfortunate I was that none of them were willing to entertain the possibility that I divide my attention between two commitments.

Ultimately, the following scheme roughly brought me to a decision: I sat down at my desk on a Saturday morning. For each job, I compiled every piece of evidence. This included all my applications, CVs, cover letters, requests for references, interview prep, conversations with past employees and/or potential supervisors/colleagues, and any readings I started on. Naturally, I kept records of how efficiently I allocated my resources in completing all of these, and hoping this made for enough evidence to filter out my periodic grouchiness, I settled on the [FUSRP](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/25-26/2025-FUSRP). Compared to the other roles, I was more frontfooted with my get-up-to-speed readings, the tedium of applying provided less veritable friction (despite having to sort out an incomprehensible clerical error with one of my references), and I've given myself a greater headstart on the project itself. Now I can only hope this reflects a superior keenness for this work.

I'm guilty of having navigated most of my social life on autopilot, and thus only a countable number of times have I had to seriously contemplate bowing out of a relationship. A slice of canonical advice for building lasting relationships is to “find the people who make you happy”, but we are so unreliable at detecting this, specially in a life as esoteric as the social one, that the second fundamental strength is probably an even better objective function than the first. Because it's all too easy to conflate one's charm, vulgarity, or voluptuousness with the key to your first fundamental form, when it is in reality just an ephemeral honorific.

As I've grown more deliberate in the friendships I build, I've used the second fundamental metrics to calibrate the precise point at which a cheery camaraderie keels and transfigures into bitter formality. It makes me quite happy to (mostly correctly) assert that my friends all contribute significantly to my time management, my ambition, my altruism, and my focus. And if a relationship begins to tread unnecessarily over my ability to remain curious, motivated, and energetic, then I seriously contemplate how truly cheerful this relationship is making me.

Of course, this last example has hardly anything to do with relationships; the shell of the argument can be adapted to any selection of the points above.

So if Bruno understood Bayesian inference, he might recognize that following medical advice to rest, although an immediate obstacle to kicking his beloved football, could plausibly enhance his athletic performance and dilute his risk of being — God forbid — sidelined due to injury, an even greater obstacle to kicking his beloved football.
