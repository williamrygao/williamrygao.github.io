# I Shatter
<p class="date">JANUARY 2025</p>
The hand, knuckling a lone silver filigree ring, pummels <br>
the inkwell shatters and thickly yet depthlessly immerses <br>
the lineoleum in wine-colour like bloodthronged treads of <br>
a stairway to clamber upwards, to his reflection.

His alchemic gaze, unbelieving, unerring, casts <br>
his hollow word parts the clouds stricken with calamity <br>
and sifts the sunshafts as sand cascading across his palm <br>
and claws vagrantly at nature's quicksilver symphony.

From Dresden to Nuremberg, a pantagruelian appetite <br>
for inhumanity is his patrimony, accompanying the osculation <br>
of death he cannot perceive. But the sanctity whose shadow <br>
he stalks promises him a great scheme underlies.

If the levee breaks, will bullnoses be rinsed clean? Or <br>
will the current purge every trace of my forlorn sigh? <br>
Will I walk upright or hobble down in defeat? Or <br>
will I don that fateful stare and howl: *sic semper tyrannis*.
