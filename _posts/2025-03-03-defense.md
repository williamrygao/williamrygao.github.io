# Defense Against the Dark Arts; Manifest V3 and uBlock Origin
<p class="date">March 2025</p>

The World Wide Web is better with <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/" target="_blank">uBlock Origin</a>.

As we grind this Earth eternally thinner, thinner things devour our attention. The daily lived experience of a nontrivial population resembles the Great American Death Sentence that is <a href="https://www.galleybeggar.co.uk/paperback-shop/ritegxpqvavi286gp91sd0he23hzx4" target="_blank">Ducks, Newburyport</a>. Endless advertisements, unscrupulous headlines, paywalls, (insert performance metric)-bait, black hole recommendation algorithms. And those lionesses are nearing endangerment more volantly than the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-super-micro-computer-stock-231600750.html" target="_blank">Supermicro</a> stock. Call it the meaning crisis, call it accelerationism, call it brainrot, or call it my own cynicism. Somehow, the natural inference from human insatiability was an all-you-can-eat subscription to effulgent drab.

The worst part? This is the precise infrastructure that we, the human race, erected for ourselves and for our future. (It turns out that this is also the best part, because it implies there exists meaning amidst all this insipidity. At least that's what I got from *Ducks, Newburyport* and my own lived experience. I digress.)

As you can probably tell by now, I'm a strong advocate of minimalism in software and (especially) web design, and go to (inordinate) lengths to ration my attention. For some time now, I've been using uBlock Origin to exorcise all websites which fail to meet my standard of spruceness. For example, I've relegated the irrelevant sidebars on <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">Math Stack Exchange</a>:

![Math Stack Exchange](/assets/images/msx.png){: style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

uBlock Origin allows you to freely select and annihilate any CSS element on any page. That is, until Google decided to limit the `webRequest` API under <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3" target="_blank">Manifest V3</a>. Without `webRequest`, uBlock Origin is near helpless. The natural (only) recourse here is to migrate to Firefox, or some other non-Chromium browser. But that's just troublesome enough that instead I chose to level my attention into this epitaph.

At the risk of this morphing into another faceless advertisement polluting the pixels on your screen, I wanted to make this less about uBlock Origin and more about its grandmaster, <a href="https://bullofheavendc.bandcamp.com/album/310-px0-2-18-5-18-p-k-k-k?from=embed" target="_blank">attention</a>.

By far the most effortless way to govern your attention is to care with a carnal predisposition. One should understand "most effortless" in the most relative, because caring is an extremely nontrivial condition. The first step to caring is your choice of career path. Medicine and law are some of the most dependable career paths because it's nearly impossible to succeed as a doctor or lawyer without caring. Ditto for engineering, which I think is probably a better fit than CS for most. CS curricula have a strong tendency to trap you behind your monitor staring at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation" target="_blank">big-Oh</a>'s and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree" target="_blank">red-black trees</a>, while (even computer) engineering seems to involve more deliberately constructive projects. I'm far from the authority on CS careers, and I'm hardly searching for a career in CS at all, but this is why working at a startup appeals slightly more to me than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech" target="_blank">FAANG</a> or quant firms. I would even go as far as claiming that spending a summer purposefully building your own projects would be more instructive than a summer at <a href="https://about.meta.com/" target="_blank">Meta</a> or <a href="https://www.rentec.com/Home.action?index=true" target="_blank">Renaissance Tech</a>.

I am marginally more knowledgeable in math careers, and my best advice would be to maintain as much breadth as possible. Minor in statistics, physics, computer science, or forestry. You'll probably find those courses (with the obvious exception of forestry) more or less trivial provided your math background, and hopefully more useful than yet another course in commutative algebra. Even if you're hellbent on going to grad school for <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/topological+K-theory" target="_blank">topological K-theory</a> or <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lie+algebra+representation" target="_blank">representations of Lie algebras</a> (guilty), no you're not. Math is one of the more difficult fields to care viscerally about, so find your reason to before you're <a href="https://www.math.utoronto.ca/~stevo/Todorcevic_Note_On_PFA.pdf" target="_blank">forced</a>. In my own career decisions, I prioritize teaching over research because I find myself caring more about inspiring the next generation of thinking fellers than the latest application of the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Mayer-Vietoris+sequence" target="_blank">Mayer-Vietoris sequence</a>.

And while caring might start with armchair theorizing, it certainly won't end with it. Convincing the more irrational parts of your mind to care will take an irrational sum of time and energy. We're all piloting our own little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde" target="_blank">Concordes</a>.

Once you start caring (and really caring), you can start worrying about optimizing your time. And maybe *then* should you worry about uBlock Origin. And maybe *then*, attention must be paid.
