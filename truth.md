# A conjecture to end all conjectures
###### December 2024

Today, a friend of mine asked me the question that burns the
mind of every frustrated mathematician: "What is a proof?" I
haphazardly rambled about ZFC and LOST, but on my
ponderously long train ride home I feel deeply disatisfied with
my answer. I imagine she feels similarly, so I've drafted a
less naive answer.

A proof is a metaphor for truth.
By metaphor, I mean a bridge between the abstract and the
tangible. Think "life is a carnival" or "romance is a place."
Only the language of the metaphor is that of set theory, and
the concretions are still terribly abstract.

## Why do we need proofs?
Well, we don't. A plausible argument for truth will often suffice,
and will almost always be the best we can do. Conversely, a
proof will almost always be more elegant. I confess I enjoy
reading Aristotle's flowery fascinations with the universe
more than I do Euclid's rigourous geometry, and the former's
worldview has proven to be more useful than any of Euclid's
propositions. But they've also been proven to be absurdly
incorrect (viz. geocentrism). This incongruence between our 
lived experience and the scientific worldview
terrifies me. On the other hand, Euclid's Elements is bound
to remain an inexorable document of humanity's capacity to 
do things the right way. A beacon of hope amidst the meaning 
crisis. Overturning a single theorem in those books would 
amount to an upheaval to all existing logic. And if I ever 
live to see the day, I would be more than happy to become a 
full-time grain elevator operator at Ocean Spray Cranberries.

One aspect that deterred me from seriously pursuing the
humanities is Occam's razor. The razor makes perfect sense.
It's absolutely necessary to make any sort of progress in
these fields. But in my perfectionist completionist
regret-ridden ways, I can't help but feel anything other 
than unrest upon the very thought of it. I can't help but
completely lose it at the possibility that our best theories are
complicated beyond our comprehension. Luckily, math is the complete opposite.
If you can't prove something, simply strengthen your assumptions
until you can. There's no need for
a razor when everything is necessary. In this way, proofs give me just enough
epistemic security to convince myself that my work could have the 
slightest of consequences on the world. And that's why ~~tunnels~~ 
proofs are important to me.

## Why do we need proofs? (a non-dismissive answer)
Metaphors exist not only for aesthetics, but also for promoting
insight. Within even the most vapid of metaphors lurks a panoply of
parallels, waiting to be uncovered by the thoughtful mind. Every once in a while, a 
mathematician is lucky enough to have formulated a metaphor (usually several hundred years prior)
that inspires something of concrete scientific interest — molecular
symmetry, chemical equilibria, the wave equation. The mathematician acts as the 
intermediary between the unreal and the abstract real, which reduces the
responsibilities of the scientist to the real.

## A big asterisk
Not many people (even in math circles) have noticed, but the study of mathematics
has undergone some very profound shifts in methodology since the last century.
Most notably, the axiom of choice is accepted to be true by virtually every
working mathematician today. A sequence of works between 1914 and 1924 *proved*
that "a sphere the size of the sun can be decomposed and the pieces reassembled
so as to form a sphere the size of a pea." The only dubious step in the proof
was its implicit use of the axiom of choice, which the great Zermelo had introduced
just a decade prior to (dubiously) prove its equivalence to assertion that
every set can be well-ordered. In many ways, the axiom of choice was math's
quantum uncertainty principle or constancy of the speed of light. Intuition
about what *should* be true caused many to reject choice, until the great Gödel
(God of mathematical logic) proved that choice was consistent with the
Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, and mathematicians, hungry for power over reality,
allowed mathematical proof to override truth, the very mystery it was conceived to mimic.

For the sake of my prospective career in mathematics, I must accept the axiom of choice.
But the greed of the (now omnipotent) mathematician has caused a rift in mathematics of comparable
depth to the natural sciences tearing apart the Aristotlian worldview.
I can no longer say with confidence that proofs are metaphors for truth, or metaphors
at all, for that matter. Proofs now seem terribly real; so real that I hardly believe
in anything I wrote above. I guess that's why I resorted to a subpar lecture on ZFC and
LOST, why I have such difficulty answering this question, why no one really has an
answer anymore. And that's why proofs are important to me.

## A bigger asterisk
There's nothing inherently wrong with that either. In some twisted way,
the axiom of choice being the mathematical equivalent of
modern physics showing us a reality that contradicts the way we exist could
very well be just another metaphor. Maybe math has been *too*
idyllic throughout most of history, and we're only starting to get it right.
Maybe truth itself is jarring, the realest reality a dissonant mess. A little
disheartening, I know, but Occam's razor has made its first incision.
