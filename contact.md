# Say hi!
<p class="introduction">I'm always eager to discuss my work, even (especially) if I don’t yet know you! To leave comments, corrections, feedback, quips, perjuries, propaganda, threats, dust, arguments, or opinions on anything contained or not contained within this site, you are most encouraged to do so by email: wimrygao[at]gmail[dot]com. I check my email more than I would like to, and typically respond within three days. If I’m drowning in endless trivia, I might forget—in this case, feel free to poke me! Below are some Things that have recently pollluted my mind, which you may find convenient as talking points:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://store.deepvellum.org/products/schattenfroh" target="_blank">Schattenfroh by Michael Lentz</a>. A <a href="https://theuntranslated.wordpress.com/2019/02/01/schattenfroh-by-michael-lentz/" target="_blank">review by Andrei at The Untranslated</a> was enough to convince me to pre-order the English translation, but I cripplingly lack the ability to extend waking hours, the conversance in the basics of Kabbalistic teachings, the knowledge of the history of the German Reformation and Peasants’ War, the advanced understanding of the mechanics of the printing process in the 16th century, andonandonandon of Lentz's ideal reader. So if you could enlighten me with one or more of these mutations, or if you simply wish to wallow in our mutual insufficiency, please do.

    <li>
        Jets; in particular <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/jet+bundle" target="_blank">jet bundles</a>. I know vector bundles up to some sophistication — admittedly in the context of topological K-theory and not differential geometry. However I fail miserably to develop any ounce of intuition about jets.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Weyl+algebra" target="_blank">Weyl algebras</a>, <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quantum+group" target="_blank">quantum groups</a>, or anything representation theory. In preparation for a summer research excursion, I want to amass every perspective possible on these topics.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/universal+enveloping+algebra" target="_blank">universal enveloping algebra</a> and the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/PBW+theorem" target="_blank">PBW Theorem</a>. Not much to elaborate upon here, I think I'm just at a loss.
    </li>
    <li>
        This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17424" target="_blank">paper</a>. I've read various interpretations including "GPT-4o's superego shattered" to "AI is better unaligned." At first glance, it seems to me that OpenAI hasn't done much alignment at all; rather mere inhibition.

I put my whole heart into these constructions. But they are constructions.&rdquo;</i> — Saul Bellow.</p>
