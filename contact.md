# Say hi!
<p class="introduction">I'm always eager to discuss my work, even (especially) if I don’t yet know you! To leave comments, corrections, feedback, quips, perjuries, propaganda, threats, dust, arguments, or opinions on anything contained or not contained within this site, you are most encouraged to do so by email: wimrygao[at]gmail[dot]com. I check my email more than I would like to, and typically respond within three days. If I’m drowning in endless trivia, I might forget—in this case, feel free to poke me! For conversation-starters, see my <a href="/confessions.html" target="_blank">confessions</a>.</p>

<p class="introduction"><i>&ldquo;And I’ve filled the world with letters to prevent their escape. I want them in human form, and so I conjure up a whole environment and catch them in the middle. I put my whole heart into these constructions. But they are constructions.&rdquo;</i> — Saul Bellow.</p>
