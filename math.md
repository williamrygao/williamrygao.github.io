                    To an overwhelming majority of all humans, mathematics is about "solving equations". But at the frontier of science and in life, determining whether a solution even exists is often more difficult than searching for a solution, provided the knowledge that it exists. Differential equations, or equations involving an unknown function and its derivatives, have consistently supplied some of the richest and most intractable mathematical equations over the last three-and-a-half centuries. A solution to a differential equation is a function that, along with its derivatives, satisfies the equation at every point in its domain. We are certain that a solution exists for only a speck in the space of all differential equations. Furthermore, we often avariciously desire not only that a solution exists, but that there is exactly one solution passing through a given point. This is even harder to achieve. The desperate search for differential equations fulfilling these two prophecies, existence and uniqueness, forms a large part of differential equations theory and research.<br>The Cauchy-Peano Theorem was presented with an incorrect proof in 1886 and a correct proof four years later. It addresses a remarkably broad class of ordinary differential equations, yet remains in limbo between reverence and insignificance because it treats only existence, and fails to draw any conclusions regarding uniqueness. Despite its shortcomings, its proof, which we present in these notes, is one of the most constructive and erudite in the entire theory of ordinary differential equations.

                    Manifolds are the central object of study in differential geometry, and the natural extension of classical geometry on Euclidean (flat) spaces. Although not a precise definition, a manifold is a space that "looks like" Euclidean space on every sufficiently zoomed-in region. Such structures arise in the world around us at an even higher frequency than the over-idealistic Euclidean spaces: the surface of the Earth, the shape of a protein structure, and a doughnut are all examples of manifolds. The theory of manifolds is crucial to philosophical questions ("can an ant distinguish whether it is trawling across a doughnut versus a sphere?") and to our practical understanding of the world we inhabit (most notably in the theory of general relativity).<br>In these notes, we restrict our attention to manifolds that naturally live in Euclidean space. For these objects, the basic tools of calculus (namely the inverse and implicit function theorems) provide four interchangeable criteria for identifying manifold structures.
