# Facts from Silent Spring by Rachel Carson I
<p class="font3 right">1 JANUARY 2026</p>

Rachel Carson's writing is very morally-charged. I admire this a lot but I think it can be prophylactic to dialecticism and meaningful progress, so I've tried to collect some of the crucial facts and arguments from *Silent Spring* here.

* The acquisition of sufficient power by a single species (Homo sapiens) to alter the nature of the Earth by a single species is unprecedented. Even more unprecedentedly, these alterations over the past century or so are unilateral and largely irreversible.
* Life is resilient to gradual diversification but in the modern world environments change far quicker than they can adapt.
* In the US, 500 new chemicals are introduced to nature every year. Over 200 for killing insects, weeds, rodents, and other 'pests'.
* We are told that pesticides are necessary to maintain agricultural production, but the US suffers from overproduction. The American taxpayer in 1962 is is paying out more than 1 billion dollars a year to store surplus food.
* Of course, insects compete with humans in other ways: as competitors for the food supply and as carriers of human disease.
* Monoculture is largely responsible for pest issues in agriculture, as it is easy for wheat-inhabiting pests to grow abundantly in a habitat consisting exclusively of wheat, while more diversity in crops would help control populations. Think elm trees and beetles.
* Plant importation is another primary agent in the modern spread of species, especially pests. The US Office of Plant Introduction has introduced almost 200,000 species of plants. Nearly half of the 180 or so major insect enemies of US plants are accidental imports.
* Quarantine and pesticides are "only extremely expensive ways of buying time".
* "The obligation to endure gives us the right to know". (Jean Rostand)
