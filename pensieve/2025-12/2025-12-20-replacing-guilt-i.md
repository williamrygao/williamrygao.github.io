The first in a series of essays by Nate Soares describing a path to reorienting motivation away from guilt and shame. Here Nate denounces the false dichotomy of 'slackers' (whose preferences are orthogonal to quality of work) and 'tryers' (whose preferences are parallel to quality of work). In the fuzzy reality he describes, the preferences of most people lie somewhere in between. His slogan 'succeed, with no wasted motion' invites the analogy of projecting one's preference vector onto the quality line to obtain a relatively robust evaluation metric. Of course, one need not forget about the remaining dimensions of their preference vector! My analogy carries the unfortunate assumption that preferences are linear, which I'm quite sure is unbelievably false.

The prototypical example he refers to throughout is schoolwork, so there may be objections to how useful his strategy remains with respect to more ill-defined (there is no prescribed quality line), critical (lives at risk), or insurmountable (the quality line is genuinely out of reach) work. I think almost all real-world work falls into at least one of these categories. I think Nate kind of addresses the objections, by possibly exploiting the very ill-definedness in the way he talks about 'preferences'. Moreover, even the most ill-defined, critical, and insurmountable tasks can be scaffolded into very realizable quality targets, and in cases where the scaffolding is near optimal (hint: it rarely is), I don't see anything wrong with hitting these quality targets while minimizing effort. I suppose the best scaffolding should be conducive to this way of productivity; in fact I think my best scaffolding work has implicitly used this heuristic.

Nate makes an interesting point about how reaching the quality target with minimum effort can gamify otherwise 'work', satisfying both the slacker's boredom (tedious work becomes a fun optimization problem) and the tryer's perfectionism (lofty quality target becomes optimization target which is probably even harder). I don't mean to encourage cramming or deadline-fighting, but I believe these habits are so common because they are secretly more fun.

Of course, the slacker and tryer prototypes are a bit extreme. Almost no one is truly paralyzed by akrasia or perfection. Eventually, most slackers scrape by in their courses with the help of an all-nighter or two, and most tryers at some point stop editing and submit the paper. Most slackers are tryers in certain tasks, and vice versa. But Nate is arguing that we waste more motion than we think. And since arbitrary quality lines are a primary contributor to guilt and shame, breaking the false dichotomy of slacker/tryer is a prerequisite to replacing guilt and shame with intrinsic motivation. In some way we're replacing guilt from falling short along arbitrary quality lines with guilt from failing to meet one's preferences, and while the latter guilt can still be unhealthy, I'm inclined to agree with Nate that we have a better shot (in the sense of motivation) at addressing it.

The upshot for most readers will be to think real hard about one's preferences before adhering to arbitrary quality lines, possibly prescribed by an authority. Unfortunately, this is extremely difficult and if you find the process to be frictionless you're probably deceiving yourself. This is a point where I become really bad at giving advice, so I hope one of the later essays in this series will address it.
